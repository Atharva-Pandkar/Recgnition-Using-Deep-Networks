# Recgnition Using Deep Networks
 
# Brief Description: 

The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of deep networks and build a CNN network mainly by Pytorch package. I first set up the model by the MNIST digit dataset, which is regarded as the hello world of CNN, basic operations such as loading data and writing training status, understanding training and testing processes, then start to examine different layers of the network, what is the shape of convolutional layer 1, what are the filters correspondingly, build my own model, and then using my own handwriting as another testing dataset to see how it works for the new unknown and real dataset.  Lastly, I tunned up the parameters such as batch size and epochs, to analyze how an optimal point to be reached under such object recognition.
